# Java Virtual Threads Example Explained

This Java code snippet demonstrates the use of virtual threads for handling concurrency. Virtual threads are a feature in Java for managing a large number of concurrent tasks efficiently.

## Code Breakdown

### `performSimpleOperation` Method

```java
public static void performSimpleOperation() {
    while (true) {
        int result = 42 * 42;
        try {
            Thread.sleep(1000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

- This method contains an infinite loop that performs a simple calculation (`42 * 42`).
- The `Thread.sleep(1000)` call causes the thread to pause for 1 second, simulating a task with periodic delay.
- This method represents a task that will be executed repeatedly by each virtual thread.

### `main` Method

```java
public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException {
    int numThreads = 1000000;
    List<Future<?>> futures = new ArrayList<>();
    ExecutorService executor = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor();

    for (int i = 0; i < numThreads; i++) {
        Future<?> future = executor.submit(VirtualThreads::performSimpleOperation);
        futures.add(future);
    }

    for (Future<?> future : futures) {
        future.get();
    }

    executor.shutdown();
}
```

- **Number of Threads**: `int numThreads = 1000000;` sets up one million virtual threads.
- **Futures List**: A list to track the completion of each task.
- **Executor Service**: `Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()` creates an executor for handling virtual threads.
- **Task Submission**: The loop submits the `performSimpleOperation` method to the executor. Each submission returns a `Future` object, added to the `futures` list.
- **Await Completion**: The second loop waits for all tasks to complete using `future.get()`.
- **Shutdown Executor**: Finally, `executor.shutdown()` gracefully shuts down the executor service.

## Understanding Virtual Threads and Futures in Java

- **Virtual Threads**: They are lightweight and efficient, allowing for high concurrency. Ideal for IO-intensive tasks.
- **Futures**: Represent the result of an asynchronous operation. Useful for managing and tracking the completion of tasks.

## Conclusion

- While Java does not have `async` and `await` constructs like C# or JavaScript, virtual threads combined with futures offer a robust alternative for handling concurrency.
- This approach is particularly effective for IO-bound operations where managing many simultaneous tasks is crucial.
